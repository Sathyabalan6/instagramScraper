# UI/UX Design System & Heuristics

Actionable, production-grade UI/UX design heuristics synthesized from leading design engineers and creators.
Reference these principles when architecting screens, refining typographic rhythm, calibrating negative space, or conducting design reviews.

## Pre-Flight UI/UX Audit Checklist

Before finalizing any interface layout or component hierarchy, audit against these verified fundamentals:

- [ ] **Spatial Consistency**: Are margins, gutters, and inner paddings adhering strictly to the 8-point spatial grid?
- [ ] **Visual Separation**: Are cards and structural containers separated primarily via intentional negative space rather than heavy divider borders?
- [ ] **Typographic Anchor**: Is body and title text left-aligned to establish a single vertical scanning anchor rather than centered jagged lines?
- [ ] **Action Hierarchy**: Is there exactly one primary CTA above the fold, using explicit verb-noun copywriting ('Create Project', not 'Submit')?
- [ ] **Safe Touch Targets**: Do interactive touch elements meet the minimum 44×44pt mobile bounding box?

## Parametric Design Tokens

> _Baseline system tokens (8-point spatial grid, WCAG targets) calibrated alongside extracted creator constraints:_ 

| System Token | Standard Value | Practical Application |
|---|---|---|
| **Base Grid** | `8px` (`0.5rem`) | Micro adjustments use `4px` half-steps; macro layout uses `16px`, `24px`, `32px`, `48px`, `64px`. |
| **Card Padding** | `16px` (compact) / `24px` (comfortable) | Uniform internal breathing room for content containers. |
| **Touch Target** | Minimum `44×44px` (mobile), `32×32px` (desktop) | Prevents missed taps and motor strain on touchscreens. |
| **Border Radius** | `4px` (inputs/tags), `8px` (buttons), `16px` (cards/modals), `9999px` (capsules) | Smooth corner curvature matching container scale. |
| **Hairline Borders** | `1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` (Dark) / `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` (Light) | Subtle surface elevation without visual heavy lines. |
| **Typography Scale** | Headline `24–32px` (1.2 lh), Body `14–16px` (1.5 lh), Caption `12–13px` (1.4 lh) | Legible reading hierarchy with optical line-height balance. |
